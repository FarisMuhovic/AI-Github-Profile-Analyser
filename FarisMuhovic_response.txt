        Analyze the user's activity to infer their development expertise, including their familiarity with different programming languages, tools, and frameworks, and their involvement in various projects. Additionally, consider:
            - The scope and complexity of repositories they contribute to, potentially indicating their level of experience (e.g., beginner, intermediate, or expert).
            - The diversity of the repositories, which may reflect their interests across different technology stacks (e.g., web development, machine learning, DevOps).
            
        Settings:
            - Max Word Count for Analysis: 1000 words.
            - Handle Missing Data: If `topics` or `keywords` are missing, mention it as "No relevant data available" or "No topics found."
            - Tone: Provide a balanced and insightful tone, with an emphasis on constructive feedback.
            - Fallback for Missing Fields: If the sentiment is not available, explain that the sentiment might be unclear due to limited project documentation.

        Analyze the user's expertise, project complexity, sentiment, and keywords. For each project:
        - Evaluate the overall complexity based on word count, sentiment, and keywords.
        - Identify any trends in the topics or technologies.
        - Offer insights into the user's development expertise based on their contributions.
        - Provide a summary of their strengths and potential areas for improvement.
        
        The final question we want to be answered is what kind of career in IT would this developer prefer ?
